# Bujji - Emotion-Sensitive Chatbot

**Bujji** is a simple chatbot designed to engage with users empathetically. It uses basic machine learning models and neural network concepts to detect and respond to emotional cues in text.

## üåü Features

- Emotion-aware response generation
- Simple user interface for chat
- Neural network-based backend
- Comparison of multiple machine learning models
- Facial emotion recognition reference data
- Uses CNN for feature extraction

## üß† Tech Stack

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Frontend)
- Python (Backend logic & model)
- Machine Learning (SVM, RF, CNN, ResNet, etc.)
- Deep Learning (ANN, CNN architectures)
- Dataset: Facial expressions dataset (used for training emotion model)

## üìä Accuracy Comparison

Models like VGG16, ResNet, ANFIS, SVM, and others have been compared. The proposed method performs competitively in terms of accuracy.

## üß™ How It Works

1. **User inputs their name and chats.**
2. **Bot detects emotional context from text.**
3. **Bot responds empathetically.**
4. **Trained ML models can also process facial data (optional extension).**
